ECE 140B Group Assignment 2

- We chose a dataset containing the number of searches of various diseases in the US over time. 
  More information on the dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/GoogleNewsLab/health-searches-us-county
  We chose this in particular because our project is centered around health and we wanted to get a broader sense of health concerns in the US.

- The five questions we chose to answer are:
  
  Which city makes the most searches regarding diseases?
  
  Conversely, which city had the fewest searches regarding diseases?
  
  Which year were the most searches done?
  
  Which disease is searched the most?
  
  Conversely, which disease is searched the least?

- The results of our data analysis show that Rochester, Minnesota makes more searches of diseases than Glendive, Montana.
  Our results also showed that searches increase over time, possibly because of the higher accessibility of Internet overtime.
  Finally, our results show that cancer seems to be the biggest concern for Americans, and that cardiovascular diseases are less of a concern.
