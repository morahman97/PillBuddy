Our product is a smart pillbox. One of our targeted customers is parkinson's patients because they take a lot of pills. The microcontroller can collect basic movement data. Therefore, we think it is benefitial to use the movement data to predict whether the person has parkinson's disease or not or what stage is in with the data. We haven't collected much data from our device yet so we are using this Kaggle dataset.
