Our product is a smart pillbox. One of our targeted customers is parkinson's patients because they take a lot of pills. The microcontroller can collect basic movement data. Therefore, we think it is benefitial to use the movement data to predict whether the person has parkinson's disease or not or what stage is in with the data. We haven't collected much data from our device yet so we are using this dataset. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons

The dataset has speech data recorded for both healthy people and parkinson's patients. Although our device doesn't have microphone, we might incorporate one in the future to make it easy to interact with. With voice control, it might be easier for them to open the box and we can use that voice data to predict the disease as well.
