# 140B-Group
Group Repo for ECE 140B

For the landing page, we wanted to keep a consistent blue and white color scheme, as we wanted to incorporate colors that would
promote a clean and easy to read experience.
Another design decision we took for the landing page was to orient our page along the three core features of our product.
This can be seen in the three sub columns found in the bottom half of the landing page, where we briefly go over the features.
Finally, we wanted to create a slogan and key value proposition that promoted the idea of a sense of 'freedom' with using our product,
but is not excessively forcing this idea onto the viewer. This can be seen in our word choices for the sections.
